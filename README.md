 ## Overview

 This project centers on the design, development, and implementation of an advanced embedded system to control a Kinova robotic arm for precise and efficient pick-and-place  operations. The primary objective is to enhance the robot’s capability to accurately grasp
 and place a specific object, The project involves the creation of a software architecture that
 facilitates seamless communication, precise control, and tight synchronization between the
 embedded system and the robotic arm.
 A key component of this work is the development of control algorithms that manage
 the robot’s movements. The system was programmed to process sensory data from the
 environment, allowing the robotic arm to detect and recognize the target object reliably.
 Once identified, the system executes the necessary control commands to guide the robotic
 arm through the appropriate motion sequence, ensuring accurate object grasping and
 placement. Throughout the project, rigorous testing and evaluation were conducted to
 assess the system’s performance, reliability, and efficiency in real-world scenarios.The
 testing phase ensured that the embedded system met the required specifications and
 consistently delivered precise results.
 The final report encapsulates the project’s successes, the challenges encountered, and
 recommendations for future enhancements.

## Host organization
 City, University of London, located in the heart of London, served as the host organization
 for this internship project. The School of Science and Technology provided exceptional
 support with its state-of-the-art research facilities and extensive resources, essential for
 the project’s success. The academic experts at the School, renowned for their expertise
 in their fields, offered invaluable guidance throughout the project. Their knowledge and
 mentorship were crucial in steering the project toward successful completion, ensuring
 high standards and effective outcomes.

## Main steps 

In my Kinova Gen3 robotic arm project, I focused on optimizing pick-and-place operations so that the robotic arm could accurately handle objects regardless of their orientation or position within the camera’s field of view (FOV).

Main Steps:

- **Kortex API Setup**: Configured the robotic arm using the Kortex API and calibrated it for precise control with six degrees of freedom (DOF).
- **Camera Integration**: Connection to a camera system to capture real-time data and enable detection and analysis of objects within its FOV.
- **Algorithm Development**: Developed Python algorithms that enabled the arm to pick and place objects at any orientation and position within the camera’s FOV.
- **Testing and Refinement**: Conducted thorough testing and refinement to ensure the system could accurately and efficiently handle objects in various scenarios.
