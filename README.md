 ## Overview

 This project centers on the design, development, and implementation of an advanced embedded system to control a Kinova robotic arm for precise and efficient pick-and-place  operations. The primary objective is to enhance the robot’s capability to accurately grasp
 and place a specific object, The project involves the creation of a software architecture that
 facilitates seamless communication, precise control, and tight synchronization between the
 embedded system and the robotic arm.
 A key component of this work is the development of control algorithms that manage
 the robot’s movements. The system was programmed to process sensory data from the
 environment, allowing the robotic arm to detect and recognize the target object reliably.
 Once identified, the system executes the necessary control commands to guide the robotic
 arm through the appropriate motion sequence, ensuring accurate object grasping and
 placement. Throughout the project, rigorous testing and evaluation were conducted to
 assess the system’s performance, reliability, and efficiency in real-world scenarios.The
 testing phase ensured that the embedded system met the required specifications and
 consistently delivered precise results.
 The final report encapsulates the project’s successes, the challenges encountered, and
 recommendations for future enhancements.
